This website is the online material for the workshop **An Introduction to Eco-spatial Data in R: Accessing, Visualizing, and Applying Machine Learning** at [**Entomology 2025**](https://www.entsoc.org/events/annual-meeting).

## Workshop Objectives

By the end of this course, attendees will be able to:

-   Identify some landscape online data resources that can be used for insect distribution mapping

-   Load GIS data layers into R and clean and visualize them in preparation for modeling

-   Use an R package to search for and download georeferenced citizen science observation records from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/)

-   Fit a simple species distribution model using the random forest machine learning algorithm

-   Visualize the species distribution model results using R
