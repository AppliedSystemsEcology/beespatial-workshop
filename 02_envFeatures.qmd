# Objectives

-   Identify some landscape online data resources that can be used for insect distribution mapping

-   Load GIS data layers into R and clean and visualize them in preparation for modeling

# Landscape data resources

We'll be downloading data using two different resources that serve landscape data to researchers:

-   [BeeSpatial](https://beesuite.psu.edu/beespatial/) - A portal to access research data layers and summaries that extends the information presented on the [Beescape app](https://beescape.psu.edu/)

-   [`rlandfire`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rlandfire/vignettes/rlandfire.html) - an R package that provides access to a diverse suite of spatial data layers from [LANDFIRE](https://landfire.gov/), that provides data layers for wildfire management, fuel modeling, ecology, natural resource management, climate, conservation, etc.

These resources take two different approaches to serving data, as you'll see.

## BeeSpatial

### Download BeeSpatial data

BeeSpatial has a point-and-click graphical user interface. We will use it to download raster layers for climate, nesting habitat, and seasonal floral resources. Statewide rasters for these layers can be selected using the **Select geographic boundaries** option in the **Select locations** step. [More information on using BeeSpatial can be found here.](https://climateecology.github.io/beespatial-tutorial/)

![BeeSpatial interface. Preparing to download statewide rasters for Oregon.](media/beespatial_loc.jpg) For this workshop, we will need the following statewide layers, for Oregon, from BeeSpatial:

-   Monthly maximum and minimum temperatures for 2020
-   Monthly total precipitation for 2020
-   ~~*Pollinator foraging resource in spring, summer, and fall at 5km range for 2015-2023*~~
-   ~~*Pollinator nesting resources at 5km range for 2015-2023*~~

### Load the downloaded data

```{r}
library(terra)

downloadpath <- "download/Oregon_raster_data/"   # change to your download location

tmin <- rast(paste0(downloadpath,"tmin_2020_STATE_FIPS_41.tif"))
tmax <- rast(paste0(downloadpath,"tmax_2020_STATE_FIPS_41.tif"))
pr <- rast(paste0(downloadpath, "pr_2020_STATE_FIPS_41.tif"))

```

If we take a look at one of the downloaded climate datasets:

```{r}

pr

```

Notice that the downloaded climate data is in geographic coordinates, which is designed for a sphere and uses angles to indicate location and distance. Note that the resolution of each pixel is `0.04166667, 0.04166667  (x, y)`. These values are in units of degrees. We want to change this to a projected coordinate system, which represents consistent units on the ground and matches with the LANDFIRE data.

### Change the projection

We're going to use the [Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone 10N projection](https://epsg.io/32610), which works well for the state of Oregon.

```{r}

tmin <- terra::project(tmin, "epsg:32610")   # 32610 indicates the EPSG code for UTM 10N
tmax <- terra::project(tmax, "epsg:32610") 
pr <- terra::project(pr, "epsg:32610")

pr

```

Now looking at the attributes of the climate data, we see that the resolution value is much larger (`3658.236, 3658.236  (x, y)`). This is because they are now in units of meters. Each pixel of this raster has resolution of roughly 4km. We will use this as a template for the LANDFIRE data layers, since this is our coarsest resolution layer.

## `rlandfire`

### Download `rlandfire` data

We will use `rlandfire` to get additional landscape data:

-   Elevation
-   ~~*Vegetation cover*~~

See the [`rlandfire` tutorial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rlandfire/vignettes/rlandfire.html) for more background about these steps.

As a first step, load the package and use one of the climate layers (loaded in the previous step) to determine the area of interest (AOI) that we will use to get the LANDFIRE data. We can use the `rlandfire` function `getAOI` to do this.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(rlandfire)

aoi <- getAOI(tmin)
aoi

```

The AOI is specified in geographic coordinates, with is what is required by the LANDFIRE API that `rlandfire` is talking to.

To request layers using `rlandfire` we have to specify the LANDFIRE products using their abbreviated names. The layers can be viewed [here](https://lfps.usgs.gov/products), which is also accessible using the package function `rlandfire::viewProducts()`. We will be selecting the elevation layer:

-   `ELEV2020` = 2020 elevation
-   `200EVH` = existing vegetation height (not used)

```{r}
#| eval: false

products <- c("ELEV2020")

# additional parameters
email <- "rlandfire@example.com"
lfpath <- paste0(getwd(),"/download/lf.zip")   # change to your FULL download path
projection <- 32610                            # UTM 10N
resolution <- res(tmin)[1]                     # match climate data resolution

resp <- landfireAPIv2(products = products,
                    aoi = aoi, 
                    projection = projection,
                    resolution = resolution,
                    email = email,
                    path = lfpath,
                    verbose = FALSE)

```

### Load the downloaded data

In order to load the layer into R, unzip the file at the location you indicated in `lfpath`. We want the file with the extension '.tif'. The filename produced is long, so we've renamed it to 'elevation.tif' in these directions.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: Elevation data from LANDFIRE.

elev <- rast(paste0(downloadpath, "elevation.tif"))

plot(elev)

```

# Data aggregation and cleaning

We need to prepare these data layers for analysis. This means:

1.  We need the layers to represent the desired inputs of our species distribution model.  
2.  We need the pixels of each layer to match with the corresponding pixels in the other layers.

## Prepare model inputs

For our species distribution model, we are planning to use **mean precipitation**, **mean temperature**, and **elevation** as inputs. We already have elevation.

Let's look at the climate data from BeeSpatial. This data originates from the [PRISM group](https://prism.oregonstate.edu/), which produces weather raster layers from climate station data.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: Contents of the minimum temperature raster.

plot(tmin)

```

As you can see, this data is comprised of 12 layers. Each layer represents the minimum temperature for the month indicated by the last two digits of the layer name, e.g., May of 2020: "tmin202005". What we want, however, is the mean temperature over the whole year. To get this, we will perform some aggregation.

### Data aggregation: Calculate annual mean temperature

To get a mean annual temperature raster, we will combine the monthly min (**tmin**) and max (**tmax**) temperature layers in this way:

1. Average **tmin** and **tmax** pixels for each month to get a monthly mean --> **tmean_mon**
2. Average monthly means across the year to get the average temperature for the year --> *tmean_yr**

#### 1. Calculate monthly mean temperature `tmean_mon`

We can calculate the monthly average for each month by simply adding the **tmin** and **tmax** rasters and dividing by two. This is possible because these rasters' layers match so that the first layer (January) of **tmin** is added to the first layer of **tmax** and divided by two, etc.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: Calculated mean monthly temperature. The layer names are inherited from tmin.

tmean_mon <- (tmin + tmax)/2

plot(tmean_mon)
```

#### 2. Calculate annual mean temperature `tmean_yr`

We simply use `mean()` to calculate the mean across month layers in the **tmean_mon** raster.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: Calculated mean annual temperature.

tmean_yr <- mean(tmean_mon)

plot(tmean_yr)

```

### Data aggregation: Calculate mean annual precipitation `prmean`

Calculating the mean annual precipitation (`prmean`) uses the same approach as calculating the mean annual temperature from monthly means.

```{r}

prmean <- mean(pr)

```

## Make model input layers align

To overlay these raster day from different sources, we need to check if they have the same **projection**, **resolution**, and **alignment**.

Check if the climate data and LANDFIRE data have the same projection. We're only using `prmean` for the climate data, since we know they're all from the same source.

```{r}

same.crs(crs(prmean), crs(elev))

```

We expected the projection to be the same because we requested a specific projection in `rlandfire`.

Check if the resolution is the same.

```{r}

all.equal(res(prmean), res(elev))

```

It looks like there's a small difference resolution. If you compare the actual values of the climate data (`res(prmean)`) and elevation (`res(elev)`), it looks like the LANDFIRE layer only matches the climate layer resolution to the nearest whole number. This means that these layers also don't align over their extents.

### Resample

To make these layers' resolution match and their pixels align, we will use resampling. This means transferring the raster data to a new pixel grid. We will do this by matching the `elev` raster grid to that of the climate datasets. To translate the data to the new grid, we will use the **nearest neighbor function**, which simply assigns pixel values to the new grid based on the value of the nearest pixel value from the old grid. There are other options that use continuous interpolation but we're keeping it simple for this workshop.

```{r}

elev2 <- resample(elev,            # layer to be resampled
                  prmean,          # target grid to base resampling on
                  method = "near"  # method is nearest neighbor
                  )

```

Now we can check if these layers share the same resolution:

```{r}

all.equal(res(prmean), res(elev2))

```

And if their extents are the same:

```{r}

all.equal(ext(prmean), ext(elev2))

```
