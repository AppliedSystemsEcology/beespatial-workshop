# Setup

## Download workshop code and data from the repository

To follow along with the workshop on your own computer, you will need to download the contents from the [workshop repository](https://github.com/AppliedSystemsEcology/beespatial-workshop), click on the green **\<\>Code** button and select **Download ZIP**. Unzip the downloaded zip file and save the folder to your computer.

## Install packages

The following function installs and loads all the packages required for this workshop. While this function only installs packages that aren't currently installed, it may take several minutes.

```{r}
#| message: false

load_pkgs <- function(pkgs) {
  inst_pkgs <- pkgs[!pkgs %in% installed.packages()]
  for(p in inst_pkgs) install.packages(p, ask = FALSE)
  sapply(pkgs,require,character=TRUE)
}

pkgs <- c("terra", "rlandfire", "rgbif",
          "dplyr", "predicts", "tidymodels",
          "sf", "ggplot2", "themis", "pROC",
          "ecospat", "ranger", "usethis", 
          "rmarkdown")

load_pkgs(pkgs)
```

If you have not previously installed spatial packages in R (e.g., `terra`) you may encounter an error. The most common issue is a result of not having `gdal` installed. If you encounter an error, any of the workshop organizers can help you troubleshoot.

### Tips for installing `gdal`

Mac and Linux computers may need extra steps to install `gdal`, a necessary geoprocessing library.

#### Mac

If you are using a Mac and don't have `gdal` installed, follow [these directions](https://github.com/rspatial/terra?tab=readme-ov-file#macos).

You may need to install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) first.

#### Linux

To install `gdal` on Linux, follow [these directions](https://github.com/rspatial/terra?tab=readme-ov-file#linux).
