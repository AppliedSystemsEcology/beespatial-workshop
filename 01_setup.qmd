# Setup

The following function installs and loads all the packages required for this workshop. While this function only installs packages that aren't currently installed, it may take several minutes.

```{r}
load_pkgs <- function(pkgs) {
  inst_pkgs <- pkgs[!pkgs %in% installed.packages()]
  for(p in inst_pkgs) install.packages(p, ask = FALSE)
  sapply(pkgs,require,character=TRUE)
}

pkgs <- c("terra", "rlandfire", "rgbif",
          "dplyr", "predicts", "tidymodels",
          "sf", "ggplot2", "themis", "pROC",
          "ecospat", "ranger", "usethis", 
          "rmarkdown")

load_pkgs(pkgs)
```

If you have not previously installed spatial packages in R (e.g., `terra`) you may encounter an error. The most common issue is a result of not having `gdal` installed. If you encounter an error, any of the workshop organizers can help you troubleshoot.
