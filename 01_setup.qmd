# Setup

  - Install packages/setup environment
  - Where to find data if there are issues w/ BeeSpatial, GBIF, LANDFIRE
  - Downloading/cloning the github repo

## `renv`

For this workshop we will use the `renv` package to create a reproducible R environment. To initialize the environment first install the `renv` package.

```{r}
#| eval: false
if (!require("renv")) {
  install.packages("renv")
}

library(renv)

```

Then run `renv::restore()` to install all of the packages we will use in this workshop.

```{r}

renv::restore()

```
